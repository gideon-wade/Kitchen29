                According to all known laws
                of aviation,


                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.


                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.


                The bee, of course, flies anyway


                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.


                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


                Ooh, black and yellow!
                Let's shake it up a little.


                Barry! Breakfast is ready!


                Ooming!


                Hang on a second.


                Hello?


                - Barry?
                - Adam?


                - Oan you believe this is happening?
                - I can't. I'll pick you up.


                Looking sharp.


                Use the stairs. Your father
                paid good money for those.


                Sorry. I'm excited.


                Here's the graduate.
                We're very proud of you, son.


                A perfect report card, all B's.


                Very proud.


                Ma! I got a thing going here.


                - You got lint on your fuzz.
                - Ow! That's me!


                - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                - Bye!


                Barry, I told you,
                stop flying in the house!


                - Hey, Adam.
                - Hey, Barry.


                - Is that fuzz gel?
                - A little. Special day, graduation.


                Never thought I'd make it.


                Three days grade school,
                three days high school.


                Those were awkward.


                Three days college. I'm glad I took
                a day and hitchhiked around the hive.


                You did come back different.


                - Hi, Barry.
                - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.


                - Hear about Frankie?
                - Yeah.


                - You going to the funeral?
                - No, I'm not going.


                Everybody knows,
                sting someone, you die.


                Don't waste it on a squirrel.
                Such a hothead.


                I guess he could have
                just gotten out of the way.


                I love this incorporating
                an amusement park into our day.


                That's why we don't need vacations.


                Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
                under the circumstances.


                - Well, Adam, today we are men.
                - We are!


                - Bee-men.
                - Amen!


                Hallelujah!


                Students, faculty, distinguished bees,


                please welcome Dean Buzzwell.


                Welcome, New Hive Oity
                graduating class of...


                ...9:15.


                That concludes our ceremonies.


                And begins your career
                at Honex Industries!


                Will we pick ourjob today?


                I heard it's just orientation.


                Heads up! Here we go.


                Keep your hands and antennas
                inside the tram at all times.


                - Wonder what it'll be like?
                - A little scary.


                Welcome to Honex,
                a division of Honesco


                and a part of the Hexagon Group.


                This is it!


                Wow.


                Wow.


                We know that you, as a bee,
                have worked your whole life


                to get to the point where you
                can work for your whole life.


                Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
                Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.


                Our top-secret formula


                is automatically color-corrected,
                scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured


                into this soothing sweet syrup


                with its distinctive
                golden glow you know as...


                Honey!


                - That girl was hot.
                - She's my cousin!


                - She is?
                - Yes, we're all cousins.


                - Right. You're right.
                - At Honex, we constantly strive


                to improve every aspect
                of bee existence.


                These bees are stress-testing
                a new helmet technology.


                - What do you think he makes?
                - Not enough.


                Here we have our latest advancement,
                the Krelman.


                - What does that do?
                - Oatches that little strand of honey


                that hangs after you pour it.
                Saves us millions.


                Oan anyone work on the Krelman?


                Of course. Most bee jobs are
                small ones. But bees know


                that every small job,
                if it's done well, means a lot.


                But choose carefully


                because you'll stay in the job
                you pick for the rest of your life.


                The same job the rest of your life?
                I didn't know that.


                What's the difference?
